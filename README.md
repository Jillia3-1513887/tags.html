		<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
		<font face="verdana" color="green">
	<p>My name is Jillian Anderson and I am a student here at the University of Washington. I can not really tell you why I am in this Info class to be honest... but here I am. I can appreciate the fact that the class is not all that terrible and the fact that the professor is legitmately passionate about what he is doing. Although, he is a strange guy, but I see it as a good strange, like I want to know his entire life story type of strange.</p> </font>

	<p>Besides the fact that I am taking this weird class with this cool teacher, I am also taking microeconomics and Indian Cinemas. Indian Cinemas is another class that I really can not pin point why I am in it. I mean my goal is to major in Business Administration and it is real weird that I am not taking all business classes. But hey what is my first year in college for if it isn't to spend a bunch of money on nonsense classes!</p> </font>
